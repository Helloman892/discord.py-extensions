# discord.py-extensions
Extensions ('cogs') for discord.py [self]bots. To use these, place them into the directory that your bot loads cogs from.

### linksplit.py
Adds the command `[p]linksplit <links>`. This will split the provided `links` into chunks of five, allowing them to all be embedded (Discord enforces an upper limit of five embeds per message).
